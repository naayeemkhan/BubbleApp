# BubbleApp
simple app made using html,css,javascript 
this was given to me as a assignment in this app there are 4 circles(of diifrent colors) and 4 arrows
when you click on the circle the corresponding arrow moves towards the circle and then touches the circle & the color of the circle turns grey
using reset button the initial state of the app is achieved.
